# Discogs_to_Woocommerce
Parser that collect photos and info from **Discogs** and putting it to CSV file that can be imported to **WooCommerce**. It doesnt handle 
(at least yet) 100% of info that included at discogs. But parse correctly over 99% of items and all pictures and that can save many
hours of work. Beside that it is hard to make 100% universal versions for all needs, because discogs info structure and different needs 
for every case.  
Anyway probably i will do a bit more flexible version OOP version of script, that it would be easier to re-use it.  
  
**and here is how to use script:**  
1. If you run it not under windows then remove line 3, and win_unicode_console from first line.  
2. Get discogs tokken for your acccount (more info/place to request https://www.discogs.com/developers/ ).  
3. Edit variables/setting at script that you want to change.  
4. Run and get your *CSV* file.
